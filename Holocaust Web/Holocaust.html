			<h2>So what was the Holocaust?</h2>
			<p style="font-size:25px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;">The Holocaust was a genocide of Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe. It was a state-sponsored attack on all Jews where they would be killed in death camps. The Nazi party of Germany were who coordinated the genocide. In this event 6 million people were murdered - either in concentration camps, gas chambers or being shot.</p>

			<h2>Why did this happen?</h2>
			<p style="font-size:25px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;">THe Nazi party blamed the Jews for what happened in WW1 - more specifically what happened to Germany's economy. They were also seen as below the 'Aryan race' and were thought to spread diseases. This built up the Jewish negative stereotype - which also included Jews being communist supporters but also were avid capitalists.</p>

            <p style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;">Curator's note:  <br>This picture is children from a ghetto and I was was hoping to capture their expressions which truly show the hurt and pain<br> caused by the holocaust and then the website is to spread awareness and to are something more substantial than a peice of art</p>
